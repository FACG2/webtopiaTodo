### A simple To Do List website.
> A simple to do list website, which is responsive, accessibility, easy to use, interactive, and don't have fish memory!  :laughing: ...

### The site contains five basic files:
 1. [index.html](https://github.com/FACG2/webtopiaTodo/blob/master/skeleton/index.html)
 2. [logic.js](https://github.com/FACG2/webtopiaTodo/blob/master/skeleton/logic.js)
 3. [test.js](https://github.com/FACG2/webtopiaTodo/blob/master/skeleton/test.js)
 4. [Dom.js](https://github.com/FACG2/webtopiaTodo/blob/master/skeleton/dom.js)
 5. [style.css](https://github.com/FACG2/webtopiaTodo/blob/master/skeleton/style.css)


```
 1. index.html contains the interface of the list.
 ```

 ```
 2. logic.js contains the basic pure functions (addlist, deletelish, marklist and sortlist)
 ```

```
 3. test.js contains the test cases of the logic.js file "pure functions"
```
```
 4. Dom.js contains the code that gathers every thing together.
 ```

```
 5. style.css contains the styles used in the website.
 ```

### How does it work?
We have an input item to type the to do item, then click the submit button to add the item
to the list.
Beside each to to item we have a trash can to delete the item from the list.
If we clicked the item it will be toggled between marked and unmarked.
After submitting the items they will be sorted automatically.

### How did the work distributed?
We distributed the work, so that each team member will perform a certain task, coding functions, coding tests, coding styles
each two worked on tow functions and their tests, after finishing we discussed and gathered the whole work.
